# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 
This is a demonstration of an onlineCV with a focus on responsive design.

To run the onlineCV app locally on your machine, please follow these steps:
# Installation 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/Daniela-Caballero/portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd onlineCV
 
3. Install the project dependencies using npm. Run the following command:

   npm install

# Running the project
Once you have installed the project dependencies, you can run the onlineCV app locally by following these steps:
In the project directory, start the development server by running:

  npm start

This command will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. If the port is already in use, you will be prompted to run the app on a different port.

You should now be able to see the onlineCV app in your browser.
